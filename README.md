#MNIST Digit Classification using Artificial Neural Networks

Overview:
This project focuses on classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The goal is to achieve high accuracy in recognizing digits (0-9) from grayscale images of size 28x28 pixels. This project includes data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation steps.


Features:
Data Preprocessing: Normalizing and reshaping the MNIST dataset for input into the ANN.
ANN Model: Implementation of a fully connected neural network for digit classification.
Training and Evaluation: Training the ANN on the training set and evaluating its performance on the test set.
Visualization: Displaying training progress and model performance metrics.


Dataset:
The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits. Each image is 28x28 pixels and labeled with the corresponding digit (0-9). The dataset is publicly available and can be downloaded from here.


Results:
The ANN model achieves high accuracy on the MNIST test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in digit classification. Below are some sample visualizations of the training process and the confusion matrix:
